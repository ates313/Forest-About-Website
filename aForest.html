                        to humans?” The answers to such questions are hidden in the forests! Forests cover one-third of
                        all land on Earth and provide a vital organic infrastructure for the planet's densest, most
                        diverse life forms. Forests continue to provide livelihoods for countless species and billions
                        of people; Thanks to the benefits of forests, the environmental and economic cycle is constantly
                        renewing itself. However, people cause the destruction of millions of acres of forested areas
                        every year due to fire, agricultural land opening, urbanization, heating fuel. If they knew the
                        answer to the question of what is the importance of forests for people, they would not continue
                        to destroy it in this way.

                        attracts sunlight to the grass like a magnifying glass. The grass will ignite, causing the grass
                        to ignite, thus creating a fire.) <br>
                        Grill ashes should not be poured without extinguishing. Because grass has the potential to catch
                        fire. <br>
                        When we see a fire, we should call the 112 emergency number. <br>
                        Public awareness should be raised by officials and environmental organizations, and seminars and
                        conferences should be organized on this subject. <br>
                        We should not light a fire in the forest, if we have to, we should put a stone around the fire
                        in a grassless area.

                        a great importance for the continuation of human life in our world. The oxygen we breathe every
                        day is produced by trees and reaches us. A tree must reach a certain age in order to produce
                        high levels of oxygen. Cutting trees that have grown in natural conditions for many years to a
                        level that can give enough oxygen is almost a crime. Although articles are constantly published
                        in the media about the harms of cutting trees and various information is given, this situation
                        could not be prevented. In our country, trees are killed at a high rate in certain periods. The
                        only way to prevent this is to raise awareness of individuals.
